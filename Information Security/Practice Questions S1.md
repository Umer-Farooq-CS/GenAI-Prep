## üìã SHORT QUESTIONS

1. Explain the differences among Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA).
   
   Answer: Authentication verifies identity; Authorization grants permitted actions; Accounting logs and audits activity for traceability.

2. What are the three states of data and one control for each?
   
   Answer: At rest ‚Üí disk encryption; In transit ‚Üí TLS/VPN; In use ‚Üí secure enclaves/access controls.

3. How do hashing and encryption differ?
   
   Answer: Hashing is one‚Äëway for integrity (e.g., SHA‚Äë256); encryption is reversible with keys for confidentiality (e.g., AES/RSA).

4. Give one countermeasure each for phishing, DDoS, and ransomware.
   
   Answer: Phishing ‚Üí user training + email filters; DDoS ‚Üí rate limiting/CDN; Ransomware ‚Üí backups + EDR.

5. Why are IVs/nonces critical in symmetric encryption modes like CTR/GCM?
   
   Answer: Reusing nonces leaks keystream, enabling plaintext recovery or forgeries; uniqueness prevents reuse attacks.

6. What is network segmentation and why is it useful?
   
   Answer: Dividing networks into zones/VLANs to limit lateral movement and blast radius of breaches.

7. Define least privilege and give a practical example.
   
   Answer: Grant only required permissions; e.g., a service account with read‚Äëonly access to one S3 bucket.

8. How do HMACs provide integrity and authenticity?
   
   Answer: HMAC uses a shared secret and hash; only parties with the key can create a valid tag.

9. What is the principle behind zero trust?
   
   Answer: Never trust, always verify; continuous authentication/authorization regardless of network location.

10. Differentiate IDS vs IPS.
    
    Answer: IDS detects and alerts; IPS sits inline to detect and actively block.

## üßÆ LONG & NUMERICAL QUESTIONS

1) Subnetting and Addressing

Problem: Given the network 192.168.10.0/24, you need at least 5 subnets with roughly equal host capacity. Provide the new subnet mask, list the first two subnets with usable host ranges, and calculate usable hosts per subnet.

Solution:
- Need 5 subnets ‚Üí borrow 3 bits (2^3 = 8 ‚â• 5)
- New mask: /27 (255.255.255.224)
- Hosts per /27: 2^(32‚àí27) ‚àí 2 = 32 ‚àí 2 = 30
- Subnet increments: 32
- Subnet 1: 192.168.10.0/27 ‚Üí usable 192.168.10.1 ‚Äì 192.168.10.30
- Subnet 2: 192.168.10.32/27 ‚Üí usable 192.168.10.33 ‚Äì 192.168.10.62

2) Access Control Matrix Calculation

Problem: Users U1, U2; Objects F1, F2. Initial rights: U1:{F1:R,W}, U2:{F1:R}, U1:{F2:-}, U2:{F2:W}. Apply: (a) Revoke U1 write on F1; (b) Grant U1 read on F2; (c) Remove U2 write on F2. Provide final matrix.

Solution:
- Start:
  - F1: U1 = R,W; U2 = R
  - F2: U1 = ‚Äì; U2 = W
- (a) U1 on F1 ‚Üí remove W: U1 = R; U2 = R
- (b) U1 on F2 ‚Üí add R: U1 = R; U2 = W
- (c) U2 on F2 ‚Üí remove W: U1 = R; U2 = ‚Äì
- Final:
  - F1: U1 = R; U2 = R
  - F2: U1 = R; U2 = ‚Äì

3) Cryptography ‚Äì AES‚ÄëGCM Tag Verification

Problem: Given ciphertext C, nonce N, key K, and tag T, describe verification steps and identify what fails if the nonce repeats with same key.

Solution:
1. Recompute tag = GCM(K, N, AAD, C)
2. Compare constant‚Äëtime with received T; reject if mismatch
3. If nonce repeats with same K, keystream reuse allows attackers to XOR ciphertexts to recover XOR of plaintexts; integrity may also fail due to tag forgeries.

4) Risk Assessment Calculation

Problem: Asset value = $100,000; Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) for a threat is 15%. Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) = 0.2. Compute Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) and expected loss over 3 years.

Solution:
- SLE = Asset √ó Exposure Factor = 100,000 √ó 0.15 = $15,000
- ALE = SLE √ó ARO = 15,000 √ó 0.2 = $3,000 per year
- 3‚Äëyear expected loss (assuming independence, linear expectation) = 3 √ó 3,000 = $9,000

5) Hashing ‚Äì Collision Probability (Birthday Approximation)

Problem: For a 128‚Äëbit hash, estimate number of samples n for ~50% collision probability.

Solution:
- Birthday bound: n ‚âà 1.177 √ó ‚àö(2^128) = 1.177 √ó 2^64 ‚âà 2.17 √ó 10^19 samples
