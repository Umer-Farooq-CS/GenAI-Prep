# Comprehensive Information Security Notes

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Information Security

### 1.1 Core Concepts

**Information Security (InfoSec)** is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. It involves protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

4. **Non-repudiation**: Preventing denial of actions or communications

#### Key Terminology

**Plaintext**: Original, unencrypted message
- Example: "HELLO WORLD"

**Ciphertext**: Encrypted message
- Example: "URYYB JBEYQ" (using ROT13)

**Encryption**: Process of converting plaintext to ciphertext
- Example: Applying Caesar cipher with shift 3

**Decryption**: Process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext
- Example: Reversing Caesar cipher by shifting back 3

**Key**: Secret value used in encryption/decryption algorithms
- Example: Shift value "3" in Caesar cipher

**Algorithm/Cipher**: Mathematical procedure for encryption/decryption
- Example: Caesar cipher algorithm

### 3.2 Types of Cryptography

#### Asymmetric Cryptography
- **Different keys** for encryption and decryption (public/private key pairs)
- **Slower** processing
- **Solves key distribution** problem
- **Examples**: RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman

### 3.3 Substitution Ciphers

Substitution ciphers replace each character in the plaintext with another character according to a fixed rule.

#### Caesar Cipher

**Definition**: Each letter is shifted a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

**Formula**:
- Encryption: C = (P + k) mod 26
- Decryption: P = (C - k) mod 26
- Where C = cipher letter position, P = plain letter position, k = key (shift)

**Alphabet Reference**:
```
A B C D E F G H I J K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
```

**Example 1: Encryption with shift 3**
- Plaintext: "HELLO"
- Process:
  - H (7) → K (7+3=10)
  - E (4) → H (4+3=7)
  - L (11) → O (11+3=14)
  - L (11) → O (11+3=14)
  - O (14) → R (14+3=17)
- Ciphertext: "KHOOR"

**Example 2: Encryption with shift 13**
- Plaintext: "ATTACK AT DAWN"
- Process:
  - A (0) → N (0+13=13)
  - T (19) → G (19+13=32, 32 mod 26 = 6)
  - T (19) → G (6)
  - A (0) → N (13)
  - C (2) → P (2+13=15)
  - K (10) → X (10+13=23)
- Ciphertext: "NGGNPX NG QNJA"

**Example 3: Decryption with shift 5**
- Ciphertext: "MJQQT"
- Process:
  - M (12) → H (12-5=7)
  - J (9) → E (9-5=4)
  - Q (16) → L (16-5=11)
  - Q (16) → L (16-5=11)
  - T (19) → O (19-5=14)
- Plaintext: "HELLO"

**Example 4: Wraparound case**
- Plaintext: "XYZ"
- Shift: 3
- Process:
  - X (23) → A (23+3=26, 26 mod 26 = 0)
  - Y (24) → B (24+3=27, 27 mod 26 = 1)
  - Z (25) → C (25+3=28, 28 mod 26 = 2)
- Ciphertext: "ABC"

#### ROT13 Cipher

**Definition**: Special case of Caesar cipher with shift of 13. Since there are 26 letters, applying ROT13 twice returns the original text.

**Characteristics**:
- Shift = 13
- Self-inverse: ROT13(ROT13(x)) = x
- Commonly used to obscure spoilers or offensive content

**Example 1: Basic ROT13**
- Plaintext: "HELLO WORLD"
- Ciphertext: "URYYB JBEYQ"

**Example 2: ROT13 with mixed case**
- Plaintext: "The Quick Brown Fox"
- Process:
  - T → G, h → u, e → r
  - Q → D, u → h, i → v, c → p, k → x
  - B → O, r → e, o → b, w → j, n → a
  - F → S, o → b, x → k
- Ciphertext: "Gur Dhvpx Oebja Sbk"

**Example 3: ROT13 with numbers and punctuation**
- Plaintext: "Meet me at 3:00 PM!"
- Process: (Numbers and punctuation remain unchanged)
- Ciphertext: "Zrrg zr ng 3:00 CZ!"

**Example 4: Double ROT13 (returns original)**
- Plaintext: "SECRET MESSAGE"
- First ROT13: "FRPERG ZRFFNTR"
- Second ROT13: "SECRET MESSAGE"

#### Affine Cipher

**Definition**: Each letter is mapped to a numeric value, multiplied by a key 'a', added to another key 'b', then converted back to a letter.

**Formula**:
- Encryption: C = (aP + b) mod 26
- Decryption: P = a⁻¹(C - b) mod 26
- Where 'a' and 'b' are keys, and a⁻¹ is the modular multiplicative inverse of 'a'

**Requirements**:
- 'a' must be coprime to 26 (gcd(a,26) = 1)
- Valid values for 'a': 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25

#### Vigenère Cipher

**Definition**: Uses a repeating keyword to shift letters by different amounts. More secure than Caesar cipher because it uses multiple substitution alphabets.

**Process**:
1. Convert keyword and plaintext to numbers
2. Repeat keyword to match plaintext length
3. Add corresponding values (mod 26) for encryption
4. Subtract for decryption

**Security Analysis of Substitution Ciphers**:

1. **Caesar Cipher**: Very weak - only 25 possible keys
2. **ROT13**: Extremely weak - single fixed transformation
3. **Affine Cipher**: Weak - limited keyspace (12 × 26 = 312 keys)
4. **Vigenère Cipher**: Moderate strength, vulnerable to:
   - Frequency analysis with known key length
   - Kasiski examination (finding repeated patterns)
   - Index of coincidence attacks

**Modern Applications**:
- Educational purposes and historical study
- Simple obfuscation (not security)
- Building blocks for understanding modern cryptography
- CTF competitions and puzzles

### 3.4 Cryptanalysis Techniques

#### Frequency Analysis
**Method**: Analyzing letter frequency in ciphertext
**Effective against**: Simple substitution ciphers
**English letter frequencies**: E(12.7%), T(9.1%), A(8.2%), O(7.5%), I(7.0%), N(6.7%)

#### Brute Force
**Method**: Trying all possible keys
**Caesar cipher**: Only 25 attempts needed
**Affine cipher**: Maximum 312 attempts needed

#### Pattern Recognition
**Method**: Looking for repeated patterns in ciphertext
**Example**: In Vigenère, repeated plaintext encrypted with same key portion creates identical ciphertext patterns

#### Kasiski Examination
**Method**: Finding repeated sequences in Vigenère ciphertext to determine key length
**Process**: Measure distances between repeated patterns, find GCD to determine likely key length

### 3.5 Practical Cryptography Considerations

#### Key Management
- **Generation**: Use cryptographically secure random number generators
- **Distribution**: Secure channels for key exchange
- **Storage**: Hardware security modules, encrypted storage
- **Rotation**: Regular key updates

#### Perfect Secrecy
- **One-Time Pad**: Theoretically unbreakable if used correctly
- **Requirements**: Random key, key length ≥ message length, key used only once
- **Practical limitations**: Key distribution and management challenges

#### Modern Applications
- **Historical ciphers**: Educational value, understanding cryptographic evolution
- **Modern systems**: AES, RSA, elliptic curve cryptography
- **Hybrid systems**: Combining symmetric and asymmetric cryptography
