# GenAI-Prep

A centralized, version-controlled notebook for my course notes and practice material. I will keep adding lectures, summaries, and practice questions over time.

## Repository Structure

- `Generative AI/`
  - `Notes S1.md`
  - `Pracice Questions S1.md` (combined MCQs, short questions, and numericals with solutions)
- `Information Security/`
  - `Notes S1.md`
  - `Practice Questions S1.md` (MCQs, short questions, numericals with solutions)

## How I Use This Repo

- Capture lecture notes in the respective `Notes S1.md` files.
- Add and refine practice questions in the corresponding `Practice Questions S1.md` files.
- Keep everything self-contained (questions + worked solutions) for quick revision.

## Conventions

- Consistent sectioning: "üìù MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS", "üìã SHORT QUESTIONS", and "üßÆ LONG & NUMERICAL QUESTIONS".
- Every question includes a clear solution or the correct option highlighted.
- New semesters/sessions will be added as `Notes S2.md`, `Practice Questions S2.md`, etc.

## Roadmap / Next Steps

- Expand Information Security practice sets aligned to lecture coverage.
- Add more Generative AI numericals and exam-style mixed sets.
- Introduce quick-reference summaries at the top of each notes file.

Tip: Use Git commits to checkpoint study progress (e.g., after each chapter or problem set).
